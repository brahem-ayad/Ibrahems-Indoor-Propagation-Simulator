## To Do List :

- Simple 2D Rooms Planing System

- Heat Map of Average Received Power.
- Power Delay Profile at a certain point.

---

- Re-Implement Rays, Walls, Collision Detection,... But in 3D.
- Make a more complex 3D rooms planing system

- Diffraction
- Wall Penetration
- The ability to choose Antenna Parameters

- I might rewrite it in a way to include steady state operation (meaning that after a while, what will the waves look like).

---
Idea : if i leave a point/ball at each point the ray has passed, where each points holds a position, a power level, and a time, Then i may be able to draw a heat map of average power and a power delay profile.
